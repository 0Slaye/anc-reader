Hi! Welcome on anc-reader. This website is my attempt to recreate the "Bionic reading" algorithme. 

## How it works

> *"Bionic Reading is a new method facilitating the reading process by guiding the eyes through text
> with artificial fixation points. As a result, the reader is only focusing on the highlighted initial
> letters and lets the brain center complete the word. In a digital world dominated by shallow forms of
> reading, Bionic Reading aims to encourage a more in-depth reading and understanding of written
> content."*
